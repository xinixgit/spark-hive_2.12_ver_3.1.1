# Intro
The original [spark-hive_2.12@3.1.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.spark/spark-hive_2.12/3.1.1) is compiled against Hive 2.3.7. This is a version on the library that's compiled against Hive 3.1.2. I have tested with Spark 3.1.1 and it's working. I needed to fix the compilation error without pre knowledge on how the library works and the fix is quick and dirty. So it's likely that it'll only work with Hive 3.1.2.
